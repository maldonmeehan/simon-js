## Description

Simon
Create a version of the old game Simon. In Simon, the game generates a sequence of colored lights for you to mirror. It starts out simple; first only one color, then if you get that right then you have to remember 2 colors. The sequence does not change every time, it just gets longer and longer.

For example, here is a sequence of turns:

["red"]
["red", "blue"]
["red", "blue", "yellow"]
["red", "blue", "yellow", "red"]
["red", "blue", "yellow", "red", "red"]
["red", "blue", "yellow", "red", "red", "yellow"]
...
You do not have to use the above format to generate sequences, this is just an example.

Hint: since this game involves timed events (we have to time how fast it takes for the sequence to play on each turn) you may wish to investigate the JavaScript function setInterval().
